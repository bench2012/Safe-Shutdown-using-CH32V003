Yes, there is a potential contention issue with the state table as written. Specifically, there are two states (`POWEROFF` and `BUTTON_TIMER_ON`) where the `relayState` variable is updated. If both of these states are active at the same time, there could be a contention issue where the `relayState` variable is updated by both states, leading to unpredictable behavior.

To avoid this issue, it would be best to modify the state table and program logic so that only one state updates the `relayState` variable at a time. One possible approach would be to make the `BUTTON_TIMER_ON` state dependent on the `SHUTDOWN_ON` state, so that the `relayState` variable is only updated by the `SHUTDOWN_ON` state. For example, the state table could be modified as follows:

```
|              | Button State | Last Button State | Button Timer        | Relay | Shutdown | Status |                    |                                              |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|----------|--------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Relay        | On           | Off               | N/A                 | Off   | Off      | N/A    | Turn relay on      |                                              |
| Shutdown     | On           | Off               | N/A                 | On    | Off      | N/A    | "Turn Shutdown On  | Start Button Timer"                          |
| Poweroff     | Off          | On                | Button Timer >2 Sec |On     | On       | Off    | "Turn Relay Off    | if Status is Off or Button Timer is > 2 sec" |
| Button Timer | Off          | On                | Stop                | Off   | On       | On     | Start Button Timer |                                              |
| Button Timer | Off          | On                | Stop                | On    | On       | On     | Start Button Timer |                                              |
```

With this modification, the `BUTTON_TIMER_ON` state only updates the `shutdownState` variable, while the `SHUTDOWN_ON` state updates both the `relayState` and `shutdownState` variables. This ensures that only one state updates the `relayState` variable at a time, avoiding contention issues.

The program logic would need to be updated accordingly to reflect this modification to the state table.
